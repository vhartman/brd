Particle-like simulation of the boarding process of an airplane.

## Introduction
Have you ever been annoyed by the painfully long queue, while boarding on a plane? That moment, in front of the forming boarding line at the gate, when you are internally torn by the dilemma between joining the line before it gets too long, or waiting long enough, sitting on your bench, till the line gets shorter? Or, once in the airplane, that frustration of waiting for this one passenger in front of you, who is blocking the whole line, loading his luggage up in the cabin?

The good news is, you are not alone. Shortening the boarding time on an airplane has been the holy grail of airline companies since a long while. Many different strategies have already been adopted by airline companies to this end, such as controlling the boarding order of passengers according to their seats by assigned groups. But none of them have proved themselves satisfactory.

In this project, we will implement a new strategy with a brand new approach, based on Jason Steffen's work, Optimal boarding method for airline passengers<ref>http://home.fnal.gov/~jsteffen/airplanes.html</ref>. A strategy, that will not only reduce the cost for airline companies, but that will also make you happy.
